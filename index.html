        Dear Recruiter,
<br><br>
        I really appreciate your time and your effort in reaching out to me. These lines I wrote for help us and avoid wasting our very precious time. 
        <br><br>        
        Right now I’m not looking for a new job, but if you think you can change my mind, be my guest, go ahead.
        <br><br>
        I noticed that you need these things about me:
        <ul>
        <li>Place where I live</li>
        <li>Resume updated</li>
        <li>English level</li>
        <li>Am I currently employed?</li>
        <li>Salary before taxes.</li>
    </ul>
    </p><p>
        Well, this text is just a obviously killer list. I will cite my linked profile "https://www.linkedin.com/in/hcamachor/" as my candidate home page.
    <br> <br>   
        On the third line from my candidate home page, it is indicated where I live. But, it is important to highlight that I will never work in an office again, no exceptions. I will continue in home office because I realized that I'm very happy working from my place.
        <br><br>
        I don't want to use neither a word template even paper to share my resume, I put a big effort in my candidate home page to be very precise in my experience, education, technology, certifications, and more details to avoid using something else.
        <br><br>
        Regarding my English level, well these lines are written in english and, in regard to my previous experience, I was working in a couple foreign companies where English is the mother tongue. I have exposed my work and ideas for non-Spanish speakers and my work has been recognized by my colleagues. I know, it’s not perfect, but It is enough to connect with English speakers.
        <br><br>
        It is important talk about salary, I won't give you my expected salary, in my opinion it is rude to ask a candidate for their own price. I completely believe in correspondence, if your company is looking for my skills, at least I hope your company can establish a value for them.
        <br><br>
        Finally, I will share a bit about my current working relationship. I have an excellent position here, fully balanced between my life and work goals. Aware of my skills and my time. I got wellness, dreams, challenges, amazing training options, a great career growth path, access to labs to learning,  and a good salary.
        <br>
        I won't change that for least than that. 
        <br><br>
        If you think I am the best fit, after reading carefully my candidate home page, I insist, after reading carefully my candidate home page, I expect a couple of things, a very interesting, readable, challenging, attainable proposal and an interesting salary offer, in accordance with the importance and responsibility of that proposal.
        <br><br>
        Right after those answers, we will get together and have a serious talk about how to make a deal.
        <br><br>
        Thanks for your time.
